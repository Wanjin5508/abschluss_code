Earth connection\nTo guarantee the electrical safety, the RSE 400 (800) must be connected to the earth potential\nby way of a line with sufficient cross-section. For RSE 400, a minimum cross-section of 50\nmm2 is required, and for RSE 800 a minimum cross-section of 100 mm2. The earth connection\nis to be performed to the earthing rod on the RSE rear panel.\nConnect the RSE additionally to the earth potential of the high-voltage test circuit by way of\ncopper foil so as to avoid hazardous overvoltages in the earthing system in case of flashover\non the test object. Connect the copper foil also to the earthing rod of the RSE to ensure that\nthe neutral is also earthed when the RSE is supplied from a diesel generator.\nFor details on optimum design of the earthing system, refer to Chapter 17.\n6.2. Connecting the exciter transformer\nConnect the exciter transformer of the test system to the busbars X1.4 / X1.5 or the appropriate\nplug connectors (depending on the variant) on the rear side of the RSE.\nNOTICE\nRisk of damage to system components\nEarthing of an inverter output will lead to severe damage of the inverter unit.\n► The RSE output terminals must not be connected to earth potential.\n► Make sure that the primary winding of the exciter transformer installed is not\nconnected to earth potential.\n► Before connecting the supply voltage, check by way of a multimeter that there is\nno connection between the inverter outputs and earth potential.\n6.3. Connecting the voltage divider\nThe coaxial measuring cable to the voltage divider is to be connected to the N female\nconnector X103 on the RSE rear panel.\n6.4. Connecting safety loop, external emergency stop and warning lamps\nRSE 400 (800) meets the requirements of Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3) acc. to IEC 61508\nand 61511. This means that the external EMERGENCY STOP loop and the safety loop are\ndesigned in two channels. This prevents that e.g. open safety contacts are not detected due\nto damage in the cabling (cross-circuits). Therefore, all external safety contacts (e.g. door\ncontacts, EMERGENCY STOP pushbuttons) must possess at least two contacts which are\nlooped in one channel each.\nTo support external safety devices possessing only one contact, the RSE 400 (800) may be\nswitched to the single-channel mode. In this case, however, the safety system no longer meets\nthe requirements of SIL3. For details, see the RSE 400 (800) circuit diagram.\n6.5. Connection to the power grid\nThe RSE 400 (800) is connected to the three-phase power grid by way of the busbars X1.1,\nX1.2 and X1.3 on the rear side of the control cabinet. The neutral of the power grid must be\nconnected to the earthing bar of the RSE 400 (800). For safety reasons, the fuse switch-\ndisconnector F1 must be open during connection to the grid.\n12 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

{"id": "text_13", "page": 13, "type": "text", "content": "User's Manual\nControl and Feeding Unit\nType RSE 400 / RSE 800\nIn the case of RSE 800, the feeding power has to be fed in both in one cabinet or in two cabinet\nparts, depending on the current project. In certain circumstances, the internal connection\nbetween the two parts of the cabinets is missing. In these cases, each cabinet must be\nconnected to the supply network separately. If connection to only one cabinet is possible, the\ncable cross-section of the supply lines must be sufficient for the input current of both inverter\nunits.\nNOTICE\nRisk of damage to system components\nIf the neutral conductor of the power grid is not connected to the RSE 400 (800), the\ninternal arresters can be destroyed.\n► The neutral conductor (star point) of the power grid must be connected to the\nearthing bar.\n► Since the neutral of the earthing rod is connected to the earthing potential, no\nresidual-current-operated circuit-breaker must be used in the power grid, or - if\ninstalled - it must be deactivated.\nThe input current of RSE 400 (800) is not sinusoidal, but contains a large content of harmonics.\nDue to the six-coil rectifier circuit in the mains input, very high current peaks can result. The\nratio of the peak current to the r.m.s. value of the current is not constant, but dependent on the\nmodulation, mains impedance and on the ratio of output and mains frequency. Ratios of 3 to\n4 are quite common. An excessive mains impedance (including the mains connection lines)\ncan result in impermissibly high voltage dips at the busbars. This may lead to malfunctions and\nimpermissible heating of the intermediate circuit capacitors.\nThere are generally two types of supply mains: In most cases, a diesel generator is installed\nat the site; occasionally, connection to a 400 V mains in the station is also possible.\nIf an infinite power supply system is used (e.g. if the RSE is connected to a transformer), the\nmains must be protected from the feedback of the harmonic in the input current of the RSE.\nTo this end, the RSE is to be fitted with a three-phase current-limiting reactor in the mains input\n(L1) in the vicinity of the busbars. Since in most cases generators are used for power supply,\nthis reactor is bypassed by way of short busbars. If the RSE is operated at a stiff system, these\nshorting jumpers are to be removed.\nDepending on the design, the impedance (short-circuit voltage) of a diesel generator is\napproximately 4 times higher than that of a transformer. The internal voltage regulation of these\ngenerators is too slow to be able to compensate the voltage dip caused by the current peaks\nin the RSE input current. Therefore, as experience over many years has shown, a generator\nwith a nominal power should be selected which is at least three times as high as the power\nactually required for the test. The impedance of the generator is reduced due to the larger size\nrequired as a result of the higher nominal power and leads to lower voltage dips. In addition, it\nshould be ensured that the current-limiting reactor L1 is bypassed with the short busbars in all\nthree phases, since it increases the system impedance by approx. 90 µH per phase.\nThe mains power supply cables also have influence on the impedance of the supply mains. If\nthey are very long, a larger cross-section should be used for the cables than necessary from\nthe point of view of the r.m.s. value of the input current.\n7. Design layout\nAll components of the RSE 400 are accommodated in a two-door steel cabinet. In the case of\nRSE 800, a second control cabinet is flanged on which comprises a second inverter unit, but\nR5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx 13 / 78", "meta": {}}

General function\nResonant test systems are normally used for the AC testing of high-capacitance test objects.\nThanks to the use of these test systems, in the ideal case, the electrical power required for the\ntest can be reduced to the active power losses in the test circuit. Especially for on-site testing,\nit is imperative to keep the power required for the test, the weight of the required components\nand the installation expenditure as low as possible. The required resonant reactor is of great\nimportance in this connection. Reactors with fixed inductivity can be designed considerably\nsmaller and lighter than those with variable inductivity. To be able to achieve resonance,\nhowever, it is imperative that the frequency of the feeding voltage can be varied steplessly.\nThe high test voltage in a series resonant test system is generated by induction in the resonant\nreactor as a result of the capacitive current. The test voltage is approx. 100 … 200 times higher\nthan the output voltage of the exciter transformer and is a pure sinusoidal oscillation. The\nresonant reactor and the load capacity form an oscillating circuit. Its natural frequency can be\ncalculated using the following formula (Thomson formula):\n1\nf =\n2π C⋅L\nThe energy in the circuit oscillates at this frequency between reactor and load capacity. Due\nto the inevitable losses in the oscillating circuit (e.g. copper resistance of the reactor winding,\nlosses in the magnetic circuit, …), this voltage would fade out without compensation of these\nlosses. To obtain a constant voltage, these losses must be compensated by way of an external\nenergy source (inverter). In the case of resonance, the output frequency of the inverter must\ncorrespond exactly to the natural frequency of the series oscillating circuit. In this case, pure\nactive power is fed in from the inverter to cover the losses. The amount of the feeding power\ncorresponds then exactly to the losses and lies commonly in a range of 0.5 … 1% of the\napparent test power. The ratio of test apparent power and losses is called circuit quality or, in\nbrief, Q factor.\nIn the case of HIGHVOLT resonant test systems, the supply voltage is provided by the inverter\nin the RSE 400 (800) in connection with the downstream exciter transformer. This transformer\nisolates the outputs of the inverter against earth and adapts the output voltage of the inverter\n(approx. 560 V peak value) to the supply voltage required for the series oscillating circuit.\nHV reactor\nexciter\ntransformer\npower\nsupply\nRSE 400\n3x 400V voltage\ndivider test\nobject\nFig. 2: Series resonant circuit with RSE 400\nThe control and feeding unit RSE 400 (800) comprises all modules required for power supply\nof a resonant circuit with adjustable frequency.

Power circuit\nThe square-wave output voltage of an RSE is generated by way of a voltage-source inverter.\nA capacitor battery (C1...C3), the so-called intermediate circuit, is charged via a six-coil bridge\nconnection consisting of the diode modules V1, V2 and V3 from the three-phase power grid to\na DC voltage of approx. 560 V. To be able to limit the charging current in the case of fully\ndischarged intermediate circuit, charging is performed via the series resistors on the p.c. board\nRSE-PWR-A2 (A14). Once the full intermediate circuit voltage is reached, the series resistors\nare bypassed with a contactor. During the precharging phase with a duration of 4 s, only a\nrelatively low charging current may flow through the series resistors into the capacitor battery.\nThe converter is only ready when the circuit breaker Q1 and the main contactor K2 are closed.\nThe intermediate circuit voltage generated in this way constitutes the supply voltage for a full-\nbridge inverter in a sample-and-hold circuit containing the two half-bridge IGBT modules V4\nand V5. These modules comprise two IGBT transistors (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor)\neach.\nFig. 4 shows the general function of the inverter bridge for generation of a symmetrical square-\nwave voltage with variable duty. The transistors T1 and T4 constitute the IGBT module V4,\nand T2 and T3 the module V5.\nU out\nT1 T2 +Ui c\n+\nU ic Uo ut\nt ein t\n- -Ui c T\n2\nT4 T3\nT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nswitched on switched off\nFig. 4: Functioning principle of the inverter\nAs shown in the diagram above, the output voltage does not jump from one polarity directly to\nthe opposite polarity, but assumes the value '0' for a certain time. The ON time t may vary in\nON\nthe range 0 < t < 0.5 T. Thus, the r.m.s. value of the output voltage can be varied steplessly.\nON\nThe ratio of the ON time at the time of a half period is called duty which can assume values\nbetween 0 and 100% but is practically limited to 85%. The limiting to 85% prevents excessive\novershot of the voltage on the exciter transformer secondary side. Since in the case of a\nconnected resonant circuit only the fundamental wave contributes a share to the test voltage,\nthe generated high voltage is not proportional to the r.m.s. value of the output voltage, but\nproportional to the component of the fundamental wave which occurs at a certain pulse duty\nfactor. The practical meaning of this fact is that the generated test voltage scarcely increases\nif the duty is greater than 85%.\nR5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx 21 / 78", "meta": {}}

Instead, the so-called modulation is displayed on the operator panel of\nthe RSE. There is a linear correlation between modulation and generated test voltage,\nconsiderably facilitating the estimation of possible reserves when increasing the test voltage.\nThe correlation between the duty as a percentage and the modulation as a percentage is\ndescribed by means of the following equation:\nπ Duty factor π 2t \nModulation=cos  1− \n\n⋅100% =cos  1− ON \n\n⋅100%\n2  100%  2  T \nThe control signals for the IGBT modules are provided by the p.c. board IGBT-CTRL-A1 (A4)\nwhereas the level adjustment, electrical isolation, error, temperature and current acquisition\nare provided by the IGBT modules. In case of overcurrent, the modules gently shut down the\ntransistors automatically. This shutdown - called IGBT desaturation - is reported to the higher-\nlevel control system and leads to immediate interruption of the test.\nA critical case in operation occurs if the control system breaks down during the test with high\ntest current, e.g. due to power failure on the supply side or due to an EMERGENCY OFF\ncommand. Since at this moment the current in the test circuit flows further until the current\ntotally decays due to the natural attenuation, a current path must be maintained on the primary\nside of the exciter transformer, as otherwise high overvoltage can occur at the exciter\ntransformer.\nTo avoid such damage, various protective measures are implemented in the RSE 400 (800):\n• No switching elements (e.g. contactor) are installed between the inverter output and\nexciter transformer.\n• The supply voltages of the p.c. boards are also not shut down in case of an\nEMERGENCY OFF command. Thus, it is possible for the inverter control system to\nturn on the two lower transistors in Fig. 4 permanently. Thus, the decay current\nfinds a low-ohmic path via one transistor and one freewheeling diode each.\n• The two lower transistors are also always turned on when the system is turned off\n(prior to and after the test).\n• A so-called crowbar switch connected parallel to the converter output short-circuits\nthe latter if a voltage of more than 700 V occurs between the output terminals. This\nis a sure sign that all transistors of the inverter are turned off and cannot bear the\ncurrent (e.g. in case of a power supply failure). In this case, the enforced current\nflowing through the freewheeling diodes charges the capacitor bank in the reverse\ndirection to high voltages. The crowbar switch possesses its own power supply that\ncan also turn on the switch for at least 6 s in case of mains power failure, thus\npreventing further increase of the intermediate circuit voltage.\n• Additionally, arresters (R14, R15) are connected over the intermediate circuit which\nmay also assume energy to a limited degree which is fed-in in the reverse direction,\nthus limiting the intermediate circuit voltage to 900 V.\n22 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

Control principle\nIn the case of resonant test systems, the current trend towards higher and higher test powers\nresults in a growing demand for feeding power. Thanks to the modular control concept of the\ncontrol and feeding units RSE 400 (800), up to maximum 64 inverter units can be coupled to\neach other. Therefore, the individual inverter units (one in RSE 400 and two in RSE 800) are\ndesigned as closed units and only connected to the controller unit RSE-CTRL by way of a CAN\nbus connection. For details, see Chapter 12.\n9.5. Inverter unit\nEvery converter unit comprises all components of a fully featured frequency inverter. The main\ncomponents are the rectifier modules (V1, V2, V3) and the IGBT half-bridge modules (V4, V5).\nAll these power modules are mounted on two forced-air-cooled heat sinks. The converter units\nadditionally comprise a circuit breaker Q1, the main contactor K2, a fuse switch-disconnector\n(F1), a capacitor bank (C1…C3) forming the intermediate circuit, a discharging resistor (R1)\nand precharging resistors on the p.c. board RSE-PWR-A1 (A3).\nThe electronic components of a converter unit are distributed over three p.c. boards. A micro-\ncontroller on the p.c. board IGBT-CTRL-A1 (A4) communicates with the controller unit RSE-\nCTRL via the CAN bus and receives from the latter commands and parameters for controlling\nits main contactor K2, for precharging and controlling the IGBT modules. At the same time, it\nreturns its measurement values and status information. The values for the converter output\ncurrent and the chip temperatures of the IGBT modules are prepared in these modules and\nread in as analog values from the p.c. board IGBT-CTRL-A1. The measurement of the\nintermediate circuit voltage and the phase voltages of the supply mains, as well as controlling\nof the precharging relays are performed on the p.c. board RSE-PWR-A1 (A3).\nAll p.c. boards are operated with 24 VDC provided by a switched-mode power supply (A8). A\n230V AC voltage to control various relays, for the warning lamps and for the internal fans is\ngenerated from the line-to-line input voltage by way of transformer T1.\nThe p.c. board RSE-IFC-A1 (A5) forms the interface for connection of an external temperature\nsensor (type Pt100, X110) for measuring the oil temperature of a resonant reactor and, in\naddition, possesses two DSUB9 plug connectors (XCAN1 and XCAN2) for connecting further\nRSE 400 (800) in the case of parallel operation for power extension.\nIn the case of RSE 800, only one of the two inverter units is fitted with connections for warning\nlamps, safety loop and external EMERGENCY STOP (X80, X81), as well as with a p.c. board\nRSE-IFC-A1.\nAll components of the inverter unit, except for the p.c. board RSE-IFC-A1, are installed on a\nmounting plate. For protection against accidental contact to live parts, a few of them are fitted\nwith a transparent cover.\n9.6. Higher-level control system\nThe control system consists of a programmable logic controller (PLC) from the Siemens S7\ndevice family (A1), an operator panel with touch screen (A13), a peak voltmeter MU 18 (A7)\nand the controller module RSE-CTRL (A2). All devices communicate with each other via an\nEthernet network.\nThe controller module RSE-CTRL possesses a CAN bus interface for data transfer to the\nindividual inverter units.

Furthermore, the RSE-CTRL controls the automatic\nfrequency search and provides breakdown detection on test objects. It picks the information\nrequired for these tasks from the output signal of the voltage divider via a connection to the\nmonitor output (X2) of the peak voltmeter MU 18.\nIn addition, the controller module RSE-CTRL provides signals for synchronization and gating\nfor partial-discharge measurements (see Chapter 16).\nThe controller module RSE-CTRL and also the electronic components of the inverter units are\nactive once the three-phase supply voltage is present at the RSE 400 (800), irrespective of\nwhether the control system was turned on or the EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton was\nactuated. The EMERGENCY STOP command acts only on the circuit breaker Q1 and the main\ncontactor K2. The shutting down of the control system additionally turns off the PLC, the\noperator panel and the peak voltmeter. This mode of operation is necessary so as to be able\nto de-excite the test circuit in case of unplanned shutdown (e.g. EMERGENCY STOP).\n9.7. Measuring the test voltage\nThe generated test voltage is measured using a calibrated peak voltmeter MU 18 (A7). This\ndevice is designed for pure remote control and therefore does not possess any operator\ncontrols and display elements. It is controlled from the PLC via Ethernet network and sends its\nmeasurement values back to the PLC.\nTo measure the test voltage, an external capacitive voltage divider is required, which provides\nan output voltage of approx. 100 V at nominal voltage of the test system. The divider is to\nr.m.s.\nbe connected by way of a coaxial cable (type-N connector) to the female connector X103 on\nthe rear side of the device.\n9.8. Monitoring of the reactor temperature\nDepending on the type of resonant reactor installed, the RSE 400 (800) is configured for\nmeasurement of the oil temperature or calculation of the mean winding temperature of a gas-\ninsulated reactor. The oil temperature is measured by way of an external Pt100 temperature\nsensor connected to X110. In both cases, the monitoring of the reactor temperature is intended\nto protect the reactor from thermal overload.\nFor design reasons, it is not possible to measure the mean winding temperature of a gas-\ninsulated reactor by way of a sensor. Therefore, the PLC calculates the mean winding\ntemperature on the basis of a thermal model in accordance with reactor current and ambient\ntemperature. Each reactor type requires its own thermal model. They are stored in the memory\nof the PLC as temperature models 0 … 8. The model matching the system is activated during\nconfiguration of the RSE 400 (800). The models can only be changed with a special password.\nTo be able to calculate the winding temperature, the PLC requires the ambient temperature. It\nis measured at the rear side of the RSE 400 (800) by way of a Pt100 temperature sensor (R7).\nThe temperature is calculated continuously, also for the time when the RSE was switched off.\nThus, cooling e.g. over night is also considered. If the RSE has been turned off for three or\nmore days, the mean winding temperature is set to the ambient temperature when the test\nsystem is turned back on.\n24 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

In this mode, the frequency\nis always controlled during the entire test such that the system always operates at the\nresonance point. Thus, any changes in the natural frequency of the test circuit due to voltage\nor temperature-dependent changes of the reactor inductance or test object capacitance are\ncompensated.\nMerely for tests at a fixed test voltage and in case of danger of strong predischarges (e.g. tests\nat gas-insulated switchgear via a bushing), the operating mode [Until Uset reached] may be\nthe better choice. Thus, it is ruled out that such predischarges lead to undesired, short-time\nfrequency changes that influence the stability of the test voltage in a negative way.\nBasically, the RSE 400 (800) searches for the resonance point starting from the start frequency\ntowards lower frequencies. The time for frequency search can be reduced by appropriate\nselection of the start frequency. It must, however, be ensured that the start frequency is higher\nthan the expected natural frequency of the test circuit; otherwise, the resonance point is not\nfound.\nFor safety reasons, the setpoint of the test voltage is automatically set to 0 kV and the start\nfrequency to the maximum possible value (150 or 300 Hz, depending on the frequency range)\nafter turning on the control system of the RSE 400 (800).\n11.3.

Coupling several RSE 400 (800)\nFor the testing of large capacitances (e. g. long cables), the output power of one\nRSE 400 (800) may be not sufficient to be able to compensate the occurring losses. Therefore,\nit is possible to couple several RSE units with each other so as to generate an output power\nof up to 12 MVA by connecting up to 64 inverter units in parallel.\nIn this mode, one RSE unit operates as master, and all the other ones as slaves. All control\nfunctions are performed by the RSE 400 (800) operating as master. The slave units only\noperate as pure inverter units. Their peak-voltage measuring instrument, PLC and operating\npanels do not have any control functions. The control module RSE-CTRL in the master RSE\ncontrols all external inverter units in the same way as its internal inverter unit(s). The RSE-\nCRTL controller modules in the slave RSE are switched to \"Slave\" mode, meaning that they\nonly receive data at the CAN bus as passive receivers, but can no longer send data. The PLC\nand the operator panel in the slave units also operate in a mode in which they can not influence\nthe test. Fig. 31 shows the interconnection of two RSE 400 in master-slave mode.\n12.1. Feeding\nEach RSE unit must be connected to the three phases and the neutral conductor of the power\ngrid separately. To avoid different intermediate circuit voltages in the individual inverter units,\nit is recommended to use one power supply source for all RSE units. If this is not possible, at\nleast each RSE 800 must be connected to one common power source, since it internally\nprovides a connection between the feeding busbars of both inverter units.\n12.2. Power outputs\nThe outputs of the two inverter units must not be connected directly in parallel. This would\nresult in excessive compensation currents between the inverters, since their intermediate\ncircuit voltages are never absolutely equal due to the slightly different internal impedances and\ndifferent mains impedances. The outputs of the individual inverter units must be connected to\nthe primary windings of a separate exciter transformer. The primary windings of this exciter\ntransformer are then to be connected to each other, as specified in the documentation for the\ntest system.\nNOTICE\nRisk of damage to system components\nConnecting the outputs of different inverter units leads to high compensation currents and\nis therefore impermissible.\n► Each inverter unit must be connected to the primary winding of a separate exciter\ntransformer.\n► Connecting the secondary windings of different exciter transformers is\nimpermissible due to any excessive output currents.\n48 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

The appropriate value for one RSE 400 operated as a\nsingle unit is \"1\", and for a single RSE 800 \"2\".\nTo specify which RSE units are to operate in the interconnected system as master and which\nas slaves, proceed as follows:\n If you wish an RSE unit to operate as master, turn the slide switch S3 on the RSE-\nCTRL controller module to the position \"Master mode\" (see Fig. 40).\n If you wish an RSE to operate as a slave, turn the slide switch S3 to the position\n\"Slave mode\".\nThe operating mode selected is indicated by way of two LEDs.

Observe that only\none RSE 400 (800) may operate in the interconnected system.\nEach inverter unit operating in the interconnected system must be assigned a separate,\nunambiguously used address under which the RSE unit communicates in the CAN bus system\nwith the RSE-CTRL controller module operating as master.\nThis address is to be set using pushbutton S2 on the p.c. board IGBT-CTRL-A1 (see Fig. 41\n).The address range must start with \"0\" and must not contain gaps.

Coupling older RSE units with discrete IGBT modules\nIt is also possible by way of a special inverter module to operate RSE units of the older design\n(produced until 2009 - they comprise 8 discrete IGBT transistors, instead of the two SKIIP\nmodules) as slaves. This possibility is not limited to devices that already comprise a PLC of\nthe S7 series. Devices with a PLC of the S7 series are not supported. The inverter group RSE-\nCONV is not included in the standard scope of supply and must be ordered separately. It can\nbe upgraded at any time.\nThis module translates the current CAN bus protocol used for the older devices into the\nprotocol used in the newer devices and adapts the baud rates. Furthermore, it generates the\nappropriate IGBT trigger signals for the older RSE devices which are transferred by way of two\nplastic FO cables in addition to the CAN bus connection. Up to three RSE 400 or RSE 800 of\nthe older type can be connected to each inverter module.\n12.4.1. Hardware connections\nThe older RSE devices must be fitted with an RESO-A3 interface board that allows connection\nof the FO cables with their electro-optical converters. This board has already become\nnecessary to be able to connect these devices to each other.\nIn the case of the older devices, the coupling is performed via two separate paths. The data\nexchange (commands, measurement values, status information) is performed either via a CAN\nbus connection which operates at a higher baud rate, but only possesses a short range.\nFor triggering of the IGBTs in the slave units, the trigger signals \"Period\" and \"Pulse width\" are\nsent directly from the master to the appropriate slave units via additional plastic FO cables. To\nbe able to guarantee the integrity of these signals, each signal is sent normally via an optical\ncable and, in addition, inverted via a second cable. In this way, errors in the connection can be\ndetected reliably, and the inverter unit can be disabled separately in this case.\nTab. 4: Connection diagram for fiber optic cables\nMaster, Slave 1, Slave 2, Slave 3,\nSignal\nRSE-CONV RESO-A3 RESO-A3 RESO-A3\nXCAN1 XCAN1\nCAN\n(glass FO XCAN2 XCAN2\ncable)\nXCAN3 XCAN1\nX1-P (TT) XS-P (RR)\nPeriod\n(plastic FO X2-P (TT) XS-P (RR)\ncable)\nX3-P (TT) XS-P (RR)\nX1-W (TT) XS-W (RR)\nWidth\n(plastic FO X2-W (TT) XS-W (RR)\ncable)\nX3-W (TT) XS-W (RR)\nR5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx 53 / 78", "meta": {}}

Operation in parallel mode\nThere is no difference with reference to the operation between a single RSE 400 (800) and the\ninterconnected system of several RSE units, as one RSE 800 already constitutes an\ninterconnected system of two inverter units. Compared to the operation of one single RSE 400,\nthe individual measurement values in the screen [Test] have only slightly different meanings:\n• The value of the hottest reactor is displayed as the reactor temperature in the\ncase that several oil-insulated reactors with their temperature sensors are\nconnected.\n• The value of the ripple factor is the average value of all inverter units.\n• The value of the inverter output current is the total of all inverter output currents.\nThe measurement values and error messages of the individual inverter units may be\ninterrogated via the screens [Data of inverter unit] (see Fig. 17 in Section 11.3.6.1) and [Errors\nof inverter unit] (see Fig. 25 in Section 11.3.6.5).\nIn case of errors, the inverter unit reporting the error can be determined quickly by way of the\nscreen [Summary of unit errors] screen (see Fig. 24 in Section 11.3.6.5).\nAn error in transmission of the IGBT control signals to the older inverters via the black plastic\nFO cables can lead to fatal malfunctions. For this reason, the proper functioning of these\ntransmission paths is checked automatically when the main switch is turned on. If during this\ncheck an error is found, the main switch is not turned on, and the error message [Error: FO\nerror] is displayed on the operator panel.\nIf an RSE 400 (800) is operating in slave mode, the test cannot be influenced from the operator\npanel of this RSE. It is, however, possible to interrogate the inverter data and errors of all\nconnected inverter units.

Install all electrical connections starting from the copper foil of the earthing system\n(see Section 6.1).\n2. Adjust an appropriate transmission ratio for the exciter transformer by selecting the\nrelevant connections on the primary and / or secondary side (see Adjusting the\nexciter transformer in this Section)\n3. Specify the CAN bus addresses in the inverter units, check the mode settings and\nadapt them accordingly when necessary using the rotary and slide switches on the\np.c. boards (see Section 12).\n4. Turn on the external power supply (diesel generator) with fuse switch-disconnector F1\nin all inverter units turned on and check that the mains voltage at the input busbars of\nthe inverter units is correct using a multimeter (conductor-conductor and conductor-\nearth voltages).\n5. Turn on the fuse switch-disconnector F1 in all inverter units.\n6. Turn on the control in all inverter units.\n7. Enter the system configuration (system nominal voltage, total inductivity, divider ratio)\nat the master.\n8. Enter the limit values (max. test voltage, lower frequency limit for GIS tests where\napplicable).\n9. Enter the test parameters (test voltage, test time, start frequency).\nAll parameters with exception of the test voltage and start frequency are stored in the PLC and\nalso remain stored after turning off. Nevertheless, we recommend to check these parameters\nafter turning on before performing a test, in particular the divider ratio and the limit value for\nthe test voltage.\nSettings of the exciter transformer\nIn addition to the correct settings at the RSE 400 (800), it is also imperative to observe the\nselection of the optimum transmission ratio of the exciter transformer which has feedback to\nthe RSE 400 (800). The transmission ratio should be selected as low as possible so as to\nensure that the inverter modulation at test voltage is as high as possible. This reduces both\nthe harmonics in the input current, the inverter output current, and leads to a smaller ripple of\nthe intermediate circuit voltage of the inverter. A smaller ripple, in turn, reduces the thermal\nload on the intermediate circuit capacitors and extends their life time.\nWe recommend selecting of a transmission ratio which produces modulation within a range of\n70 … 93% at test voltage. In the case of low test voltages, this is not always possible; then,\nhowever, the inverter output current and thus the danger of a thermal overload for the\nintermediate circuit capacitors is also low.\n58 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

Test sequence\nA test sequence can be controlled both fully automatically and manually. The operator may\nadditionally enable or disable automatic frequency search.\n14.1. Fully automatic testing\nStep 1 – Input of all test parameters\nPrepare the test system as described in Section 13.\nStep 2 – Turning on the main switch\nTap the button [Main switch] to turn on the main switch.\nThis deletes all error messages stored at this time and all saved measurement values\n(breakdown voltage and resonant frequency).\nIf there are no any errors, precharging of the intermediate circuit is started via the resistors,\nand the message [Precharging] is displayed in the status line of the operator panel.\nAfter one second of precharging time, it is checked that the intermediate circuit voltage is\nincreased far enough. If no problem is detected, precharging is continued for another 3\nseconds. Otherwise, the process is cancelled with the error message [Error: Mains].\nThe automatic frequency search is always activated when the main switch is turned on. If it is\nto be activated for the test, tap the button [Auto f].\nStep 3 – Starting the test sequence\nAfter the main switch has been turned on, the message [Ready] is displayed in the status bar.\nTap the button [Start test] to start the test sequence. All further steps are performed\nautomatically, and no further operating actions are required.\nIf frequency search is activated, the RSE 400 (800) searches for the resonant frequency of the\ntest circuit by reducing the frequency at a fixed modulation of 3.9% slowly from the start\nfrequency until the resonance point is reached. During this time, the status message\n[Searching for resonance...] is displayed. The speed of the resonance search cannot be\nchanged. Once the resonance point has been found, the status message switches to [Test is\nrunning ...], and a green field with the text [Resonance] is displayed in the screen \"Test\".\nOnce the resonance point has been found, the RSE 400 (800) increases the modulation\nautomatically until the desired test voltage is reached. If the automatic frequency search was\nactivated, the process of searching is skipped, and the RSE 400 (800) increases the\nmodulation at the specified start frequency immediately.\nOnce the tolerance band for the test voltage has been reached (setpoint test voltage – 3%),\nthe test timer starts counting down the remaining test time until 00:00:00 is reached. At this\nmoment, the RSE 400 (800) ends the test automatically and turns off the main switch.\nIf the warning message [Warning: Maximum modulation] is displayed, the RSE 400 (800) can\nno longer increase the test voltage. If the test voltage has not been reached by that time, either\nthe Q factor is too low or the selected transmission ratio of the exciter transformer is too small.\nIn this case, the test must be cancelled manually by tapping the button [Stop test].\n14.2. Manual testing\nIt may be desirable to change the test parameters during the test, e.g. to increase the test\nvoltage in steps.

Changing the setpoint test voltage during the test\nThe setpoint test voltage can be changed in two different ways:\na) Overwrite the current setpoint in the \"Test\" screen. The test voltage will follow the new\nsetpoint immediately, observing the specified voltage ramp rate du/dt. The test timer is\nnot restarted, but continues to run provided that the test voltage lies in the tolerance\nrange. A typical application of this procedure is the determination of inception and\nextinction voltages during an accompanying PD measurement.\nb) Before changing the setpoint test voltage, tap the button [Suspend test]. Thus, the test\ntimer is stopped, and the current actual value of the test voltage is accepted as the new\nsetpoint. Now you may enter a new setpoint that, however, is not yet accepted. In this\nstate, you may also assign other parameters (e.g. the test time) new values.\nAlternatively, you can change the voltage steplessly using the buttons [U ▲] and [U\n▼]. In this case, the change is accepted immediately. The sensitivity of the two buttons\nis determined by the value of the parameter [Voltage ramp rate du/dt] (see Section\n11.2.). In both cases, however, the test timer remains blocked until the button [Start\ntest] is tapped. Then, the test time clock is restarted with the full specification value,\nand the automatic test is continued.\n14.2.2. Changing the frequency manually during the test\nIn common tests, it is generally not necessary to change the inverter output frequency\nmanually, since the RSE 400 (800) sets it to the optimum value automatically. Should this\nbecome necessary in special tests or should the automatic search not function, a manual\nchange is possible.\nTo this end, tap the button [Suspend test] to suspend the automatic test sequence. Then you\ncan deactivate the automatic frequency search using the button [Auto f]. Following, you can\nchange the frequency manually using the buttons [f ▲] and [f ▼]. Its influence is determined\nby the parameter [Frequency change df/dt] (see Section 11.2).\nIf the set frequency is too far away from the resonance point, in most cases, the desired test\nvoltage is not reached even if the voltage regulation increases the modulation up to the limit\nvalue of 97.3%.\nIf the resonance point is to be searched for manually using this procedure, the frequency\nshould only be changed slowly and in small steps; otherwise, there is a risk of overshooting of\nthe test voltage. In this case, the test is cancelled automatically with the error message [Error:\nOvervoltage]. To avoid this, a small value should be selected for the parameter [Frequency\nchange df/dt] that lies in the vicinity of the resonance point (e.g. 0.05 Hz/s).\nTo restart the automatic test sequence once the frequency setting has been completed, tap\nthe button [Start test]. The test timer will then restart with the full, previously entered time.\n60 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

Support of partial discharge measurements\nTo support partial discharge measurements (PD measurements) in connection with an\nRSE 400 (800), the RSE provides three signals at the RSE-CTRL controller module.\nFor the phase-resolved representation of the PD activity, a PD measuring device requires a\nsynchronization signal. To this end, the RSE-CTRL provides two different signals. One signal\nis sinusoidal and is a copy of the test voltage with an amplitude of 10 V at system nominal\nvoltage. It possesses the same phasing as the test voltage. The second signal is a square-\nwave signal and possesses a constant amplitude (TTL level) that does not depend on the test\nvoltage. During the positive half-period, the signal carries high level (>3.5 V), and during the\nnegative half-period low level (<0.8 V).\nIn addition, the RSE-CTRL controller module issues a gating signal that can be used by an\nappropriate PD measuring device to disable the measurement during switching of the IGBT\nmodules. Thus, the interference signals created by the switching process can be suppressed\neffectively. The gating signal has - like the square-wave synchronization signal, too - TTL level.\nThe diagram below shows the timely position of these signals with reference to the test voltage\nand the switching transients of the IGBT modules.\ninverter output\nvoltage\non\nIGBT T1 off\nIGBT T2\nIGBT T3\nIGBT T4\nPD gating signal\n(high-active) at X4\nsinusoidal\nsynchronizing\nsignal at X2\nrectangular\nsynchronizing\nsignal at X3\nFig. 37: Gating signal and synchronizing signals for support of PD measurements\nThe gating signal becomes active a few seconds before the switching process of the IGBT\nmodules is started and has a settable duration in the range of 0 … 1000 µs with a resolution\nof 1 µs. The logic level for the active time can be selected.\nA few PD measuring devices only evaluate the edge of a gating signal and operate with a fixed\ngating time of a few microseconds. Such devices require a burst to be able to reactivate the\ninternal gating timer again and again until the desired total time is reached. For these cases,\nthe shape of the impulse of the gating signal generated by the RSE 400 (800) can be set to\n[Burst]. Thus, a burst with the desired duration of the gating signal can be generated at a\nfrequency of approx. 300 kHz.\nThe signal parameters and the gating time are set in the screen [Support for PD\nmeasurements] (see Section 11.3.4, Fig. 13).\n62 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

Notes regarding the earthing system\nProper earthing of the test system is a vital prerequisite for error-free operation. A bad earthing\nsystem can lead to malfunctions or destroy system components.\nEspecially in case of breakdown or flashover at the test object, very fast and high transients\ncan occur. The best way to minimize such transients is to protect system components, mainly\nelectronic modules, from damage. The recommended earthing principle is shown in the\nillustration below.\nreactor\nControl and exciter\nFeeding Unit transformer\npower supply\nL1\nvoltage test\ndivider object\n3 ~ L2\nL3\nN, PE\ncopper foil grounding cable for high currents central earthing point\nFig. 39: Structure of the earthing system\nAll earthing points should be connected to each other in the form of a line, as shown in\nFig. 39\nCompared to the point-to-point earthing that is often practiced, the linear connection provides\nconsiderable advantages in this case. Compared to the very high and steep discharge current\nin the loop between the voltage divider and the test object, the currents in the other parts of\nthe earthing system are relatively low in case of a breakdown of the test object. Therefore, the\nvoltage drops in the earthing system are also low. In case of a breakdown, the potential of the\ncomplete test system is raised, without resulting in hazardous voltage differences between the\nRSE 400 (800), the exciter transformer and the voltage divider.\nUsing copper foil for the earth connections\nA standard cable has a low impedance at line frequency. In this frequency range, the self-\ninductance only plays a minor part; the impedance is determined mainly by its ohmic\nresistance. The high transient currents in case of a breakdown at the test object, however,\ncontain frequency components up to a few hundred MHz. For these frequency components,\nthe cable represents a high impedance due to its inductivity; in addition, the skin effect\nbecomes noticeable. As a result, high-frequency currents only flow on the surface of a\nconductor, and not in its interior. The consequence is a high impedance of a cable at high\nfrequencies which results in very high voltage drops in the earthing system in case of a\nbreakdown at the test object. Due to its geometry, a metal foil has a considerably lower\nimpedance for high frequencies than a cable of the same cross-section and thus reduces the\nvoltage drops in the earthing system.\n64 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}

Error rectification\nEven if the RSE 400 (800) provides a large number of functions and messages to support the\noperator, it is possible that malfunctions can occur that lead to none or a misleading error\ndescription. The following notes are intended to help to identify the correct error causes and to\ntake the appropriate measures.\nThe control system cannot be turned on.\n Check the fuses in fuse switch-disconnector F1.\n Check the miniature circuit-breakers.\n Check that all three phases of the power grid are present. To this end, measure all\nline-to-line voltages and the conductor-earth voltages on the input busbars using a\nmultimeter.\nThe control system displays unusual effects when the main switch is turned on.\n Check that all three phases of the power grid are present. To this end, measure all\nline-to-line voltages and the conductor-earth voltages on the input busbars using a\nmultimeter.\n Open the fuse switch-disconnector F1 for 10 seconds and then close it back again\nwith a jerk.\nEspecially multiple, unclear closing of F1 briefly in succession can disturb the\ninitialization (Power-On reset) of the micro-controllers on various p.c. boards and cause\nmalfunctions.\nThe test is cancelled with the error message [Error: Overvoltage].\nThere are several possible reasons for this behavior; in most cases, however, one of the\nfollowing two reasons applies:\n1. The voltage ramp rate du/dt is too high. An excessively fast increase, especially in the case\nof high Q factors, may lead to exceeding of the setpoint in case of brief overshooting of the\ntest voltage. If the limit value for the test voltage is exceeded during this process, the\nsystem is shut down.\n We recommend to use value in the range between 1 and 3 %/s for the voltage ramp\nrate.\n2. The limit value for the test voltage is too close to the setpoint. Normally, the stability of the\ntest voltage is better than 1%. If the voltage of the power grid, however, varies, these\nvariations also lead to similar variations of the test voltage for a short time.\n We recommend to select the limit value for the test voltage by approx. 3 … 5% higher\nthan the setpoint.\nThe test voltage does not reach the setpoint, and the message [Warning: Maximum\nmodulation] is displayed.\nThe compensation power supplied by the RSE 400 (800) to cover the losses in the HV circuit\nis not sufficient. Since the maximum modulation is already reached, the test voltage cannot be\nincreased further.\n Increase the transmission ratio of the exciter transformer in steps until the desired\nvoltage is reached.\n Possibly, corona losses reduce the Q factor in the case of higher voltages, especially\nin the case of small test capacitances. This problem could possibly be solved by an\nimproved (corona-free) construction of the HV connection to the test object.\nWhen performing the frequency search, the whole frequency range is passed, starting\nat the start frequency to the lower frequency limit, without finding the resonance point.\nR5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx 69 / 78", "meta": {}}
{"id": "text_70", "page": 70, "type": "text", "content": "User's Manual\nControl and Feeding Unit\nType RSE 400 / RSE 800\nIf the resonance point is not found, this has normally the following main reason: The\nRSE 400 (800) does not receive a clean signal from the voltage divider. Especially the zero\ncrossings of this signal, however, are required to be able to find the resonance point.\nThe causes for a missing or blurred signal may be different:\n1. The HV potential of the test circuit is still earthed at a point (e.g. remote cable end, earthing\nswitch in GIS).\n Disconnect the test object from the test system and measure the insulation resistance\nof the test object.\n Alternatively, it is also possible to disconnect the connection between the exciter\ntransformer and the resonant reactor and to measure the insulation resistance between\nthe reactor input and the earth potential.\n2. A connection in the test circuit is missing.\n Measure the resistance between the high-voltage connection and earth at the test\nobject with the earthing rod removed. You must measure the sum of the ohmic winding\nresistances of the resonant reactor and the secondary winding of the exciter\ntransformer (a few 10 or 100 ohms, depending on the resonant reactor).\n3. A problem occurred in the low-voltage branch of the voltage measuring system.\n Measure the resistance between the input of the low-voltage measurement part (yellow\ncable) and earth potential. It must be approx. 10 MΩ (input resistance of the peak\nvoltmeter MU 18). Due to the high capacity of the low-voltage measuring part, it may\ntake a few seconds until a stable measurement value can be read. If a short-circuit is\nmeasured, there is probably an insulation error in the measuring cable. If the\nmeasurement value is significantly higher than 10 MΩ, there is a contact problem or\nthe measuring cable is damaged (no passage).\nDuring the automatic frequency search, the whole frequency range to the lower\nfrequency limit is passed, but the RSE 400 (800) does not stop at the expected resonant\nfrequency. In the vicinity of this frequency, however, the test voltage is increased for a\nshort time.\nThis is an indication that the signal from the voltage divider is too small or disturbed. If the test\nsystem is earthed at two different points (station earth potential on the test object and mains\nneutral on the RSE 400 (800), this is occasionally attributable to compensation currents with\nmains frequency. A further explanation could be an insufficiently large signal from the voltage\ndivider.\n Double earthing should be avoided if possible. If a diesel generator is used for power\nsupply, it should be earthed on the test system. If an infinite power supply system of\nthe station with earthed (!) neutral is used for power supply, the neutral conductor of\nthe power grid may be disconnected from the RSE. In this case, however, the earth\nconnection to the station earth potential on the high-voltage side must provide sufficient\nampacity.\n Increase the output voltage of the exciter transformer to obtain a larger signal from the\nvoltage divider during the frequency search.\n Limit the frequency range to a lower limit frequency of 1 ... 2 Hz below the frequency at\nwhich a voltage increase can be detected (probable resonance point).\nIf these measures do not lead to a solution of the problem, you may attempt to find the\nresonance point manually. To do so, proceed as follows:\n70 / 78 R5001_BA9_DE-EN_2022-05.docx", "meta": {}}
